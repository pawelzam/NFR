1. Performance - how fast does the system return results?
2. Scalability - how much will performance change with higher workloads?
3. Maintainability - how much time does it take to fix the issue when it arises?
4. Security - how well is the system protected against unauthorized access and attack
5. Portability - Can the system work on different hardware/software configurations?
6. Reliability - how often does the system experience critical failures?
7. Availability - how long is the average system downtime
8. Usability - how easy is it to use the system?


Good code principles:
1. Easy to read and understand in part and in whole
2. Easy to maintain/refactor
3. Written with respect for SOLID and defined NFR
3. Simple (KISS) - don't try to re-invent the wheel, do not do over-engineering 
4. Well formed (beautiful :))- it should follow the style of creating the code accepted in the organization (code etiquette)
5. Free of useless content (I hate comments)


Clean code principles:
1. Meaningful names
2. Short method and classes
3. Free of comments
4. Avoid code duplications (DRY)
5. Covered by UT in places which require the coverage
6. SOLID
